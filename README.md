# angular-starter
A very basic example on how to build a web client with Angular 5 that consumes data from a RESTful web service.

## Prerequisites
* You need [npm](https://npmjs.com/) installed on you machine
* install the npm module *ng*

## Usage
* to launch the app, call `ng serve` from you project's root directory
  * use `--open` to let `ng` open your browser automatically
  * the default port is 4200, use `--port` to specify a custom port



## Angular CLI readme
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
